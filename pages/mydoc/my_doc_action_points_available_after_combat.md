Your division will have 10 less action points available after combat for every round of combat they participated in.

For example, if the enemy division is defeated after 5 rounds of combat, your division will have 50 less action points after the combat than it started with.

??? Can divisions participating in an attack be forced to retreat in different rounds. I'm assuming they can and can therefore expend different amounts of action points during the attack. ???
