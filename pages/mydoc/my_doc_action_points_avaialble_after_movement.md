Notes regarding how a division may spend action points after moving.

## Moving -> Combat

It is important to note that the more action points you spend to move towards an enemy division this turn, the less action points you will have remaining to attack the enemy division during _this_ turn.

Each combat is divided into 10 rounds. Each round requires 10 action points to participate in. Therefore, if you spend 80 action points moving a division before attacking an enemy division, you will only be able to participate in the first 2 rounds of combat. Your division will then retreat after the second round of combat.

In addition to moving further on the map, mobilizing infantry divisions will allow them to participate in more rounds of combat after moving, in many cases. In addition, mobilizing infantry will allow you to flank enemy divisions and gain larger concentric attack bonuses.
