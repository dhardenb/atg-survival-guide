Action points determine how many actions a division may perform during a turn. Examples of actions are:

* Movement: Moving into a hex
* Combat: Attacking an enemy division
* Upgrades: Upgrading units within a division
* Strategic Transfers: Using HQ transportation capacity points to move a division from one hex to another (???)

## Action Points Available After Upgrading

It is important to note that if you upgrade _any_ unit of any subformation in a division, the entire division's action points will be reduced to 0.
